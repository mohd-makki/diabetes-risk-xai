Efficient and explainable AI for diabetes risk prediction (capstone project).

This repository hosts my capstone project for the Computer and Data Science program at MIT.
The project develops machine learning and deep learning models to predict diabetes risk, with a focus on efficiency and explainability.

üìå Project Overview
Diabetes is a growing global health challenge, and early detection of at-risk individuals is essential for prevention. While AI models have shown promise in disease prediction, many are computationally heavy and function as ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù, limiting their real-world adoption in healthcare.
This project addresses these challenges by:
Comparing classical ML models with deep learning approaches.
Improving efficiency using lightweight methods.
Applying explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME) to highlight the most important health factors.
Delivering a Streamlit web app for real-time risk prediction with explanations.

üéØ Objectives
Preprocess and analyze the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
Build and evaluate baseline ML models and a deep learning model.
Improve model efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy.
Apply SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.
Deploy the final model in a Streamlit app for interactive use.
