# diabetes-risk-xai

Efficient and explainable AI for diabetes risk prediction (capstone project).

---

This repository hosts my capstone project for the Computer and Data Science program at MIT.
The project develops machine learning and deep learning models to predict diabetes risk, with a focus on efficiency and explainability.

📌 Project Overview
Diabetes is a growing global health challenge, and early detection of at-risk individuals is essential for prevention. While AI models have shown promise in disease prediction, many are computationally heavy and function as “black boxes”, limiting their real-world adoption in healthcare.
This project addresses these challenges by:
Comparing classical ML models with deep learning approaches.
Improving efficiency using lightweight methods.
Applying explainability techniques to highlight the most important health factors.
Delivering a Streamlit web app for real-time risk prediction with explanations.

---

🎯 Objectives
Preprocess and analyze the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
Build and evaluate baseline ML models and a deep learning model.
Improve model efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy.
Apply SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.
Deploy the final model in a Streamlit app for interactive use.
