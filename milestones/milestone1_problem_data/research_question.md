## Actionable Research Question

How can we build a reliable, explainable, and accessible machine‑learning
system that predicts diabetes risk and conveys severity levels in a way that
supports early intervention and improved patient awareness?

## Sub‑Questions

* Which clinical factors most strongly influence diabetes risk prediction?
* How well can predictive models classify high‑severity cases early?
* How should model explanations be visualized to maximize clarity for
  non‑technical health workers in low‑resource environments?
