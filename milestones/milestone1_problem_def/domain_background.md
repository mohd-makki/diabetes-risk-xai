## Domain Overview

Diabetes is a global chronic illness requiring continuous monitoring. Early
detection is critical in preventing severe complications, especially in regions
with limited healthcare infrastructure. Predictive analytics and explainable
AI (XAI) offer decision support to clinicians and frontline health workers.

## Why This Problem Matters

* Diabetes prevalence continues to rise globally.
* Many individuals remain undiagnosed until complications appear.
* Resource‑constrained clinical settings benefit from quick, interpretable
  tools.

## Data Context

The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, a standard dataset for
classification tasks involving diabetes prediction. It includes measurable
clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, pregnancies, insulin, and age.

## Alignment With Capstone Project Requirements

This background establishes the domain context, relevance, stakeholders, and
data suitability, forming the foundation for the refined research question
and subsequent milestones.
