# Milestone 2 🔍 — Data Exploration & Baseline Modeling

## Objective 🎯

Explore the dataset, perform cleaning and preprocessing, and establish baseline  
machine learning models for comparison.

---

## Description 📘

This milestone focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the creation of  
baseline predictive models.
Visual and statistical insights were generated to understand feature
distributions and correlations with diabetes outcomes.

---

## Key Tasks ⚙️

1. Conduct EDA (heatmaps, histograms, pair plots).
2. Handle missing and outlier values.
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Build and evaluate baseline models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost

---

## Deliverables 📦

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Baseline model metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, classification report).
- Saved models in models/.

---

## Output Location 📤

- notebooks/01+02_exploration.ipynb
- The baseline models used in this phase are stored in the global models/  
  directory.
