# Milestone 3 🧭 — Explainable AI (XAI) Integration

## Objective 🎯

Integrate interpretability tools to enhance model transparency and explain  
predictions made by the trained ML models.

---

## Description 📝

This milestone applies **SHAP** and **LIME** explainability frameworks to  
visualize and interpret model predictions.
The objective is to identify key factors influencing diabetes risk and ensure  
fairness and transparency in predictions.

---

## Key Tasks 🛠️

1. Implement SHAP global and local explanations.
2. Apply LIME for instance-level interpretability.
3. Generate feature importance plots and patient-specific insights.

---

## Deliverables 📦

- **SHAP** and **LIME** plots (saved in results/).
- Jupyter Notebook with visual explanations.
- Reported insights on most influential features (e.g., glucose, BMI, age).
