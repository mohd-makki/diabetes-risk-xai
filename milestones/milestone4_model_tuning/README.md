# Milestone 4 ⚙️ — Model Tuning & Deep Learning Enhancement

## Objective 🎯

Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and compare classical  
ML with deep learning approaches.

## Description 📝

In this milestone, advanced optimization techniques are applied to improve
accuracy and generalization.
A lightweight neural network is introduced to benchmark deep learning
performance against traditional models.

## Key Tasks 🛠️

1. Apply grid/random search for model tuning (Random Forest & XGBoost).
2. Implement and train a simple Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow).
3. Compare performance metrics across all models.

## Deliverables 📦

- Tuned and evaluated ML/DL models.
- Performance comparison charts.
- Final selected model exported for deployment.
