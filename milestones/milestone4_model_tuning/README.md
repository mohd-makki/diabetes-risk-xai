# Milestone 4 — Model Tuning & Deep Learning Enhancement

## Objective

Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and compare classical  
ML with deep learning approaches.

## Description

In this milestone, advanced optimization techniques are applied to improve
accuracy and generalization.
A lightweight neural network is introduced to benchmark deep learning
performance against traditional models.

## Key Tasks

1. Apply grid/random search for model tuning (Random Forest & XGBoost).
2. Implement and train a simple Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow).
3. Compare performance metrics across all models.

## Deliverables

- Tuned and evaluated ML/DL models.
- Performance comparison charts.
- Final selected model exported for deployment.
