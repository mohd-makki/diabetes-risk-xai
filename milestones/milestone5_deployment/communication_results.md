# Communication of Results — Milestone 5

## 1. Executive Summary

The model demonstrates **high predictive performance** (ROC-AUC ~0.92) and
**strong reliability** across multiple evaluation metrics. The XAI component
ensures transparent decision-making.

This results package communicates findings clearly to:

- clinicians  
- data teams  
- project stakeholders  
- academic reviewers  

---

## 2. Key Messages

### • The model is accurate  

Consistent validation across metrics shows high predictive capability.

### • The model is explainable  

SHAP visualizations clearly show *why* predictions are made.

### • The model aligns with real medical evidence  

High glucose and BMI values are top drivers — matching clinical reality.

### • The tool can support earlier intervention  

Stakeholders can use this to improve screening efficiency.
