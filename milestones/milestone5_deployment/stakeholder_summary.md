# Stakeholder Summary — Milestone 5

## What We Built

A machine learning system that predicts whether a person is at risk for
diabetes using simple medical measurements.

---

## Why It Matters

Diabetes affects hundreds of millions globally. Early detection can prevent
severe complications. This tool helps identify high-risk individuals early.

---

## Key Outcomes in Milestone 5

- The model is **highly accurate**  
- It explains its decisions clearly using XAI  
- It identifies well-known medical risk patterns  
- It is ready to support screening and intervention workflows  

---

## Impact for Stakeholders

- Clinicians: faster risk identification  
- Patients: earlier preventive action  
- Organizations: improved resource allocation  
- Public health teams: stronger surveillance tools

## Next Step

Milestone 6 will package and prepare the application for real-world deployment.
