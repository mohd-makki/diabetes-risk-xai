# Milestone 5 🚀 — Deployment & Streamlit App

This directory contains the Streamlit deployment for the Diabetes Risk XAI
project.

## What is included

- `app/streamlit_app.py` — production-ready Streamlit app that:
  - Loads model artifacts from `/models/`
  - Displays prediction UI (enter patient features)
  - Shows predicted probability and color-coded severity
  - Renders SHAP force HTML files and LIME HTML files generated by the XAI
    notebook (`03_explainability.ipynb`)
  - Allows download of artifacts

- `milestone5.md` — narrative & deliverables for the milestone.

## How to run locally

1. Activate your project virtual environment with all dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. From the repo root run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run milestones/milestone5_deployment/app/streamlit_app.py

3. If we prefer to run from inside the milestone folder:

   ```bash
   cd milestones/milestone5_deployment
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

## How to deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push the repo to GitHub (we must be sure models/, results/ and milestones/\
   milestone5_deployment/app/streamlit_app.py are present).
2. Go to <https://share.streamlit.io> and connect to GitHub repo.
3. Select milestones/milestone5_deployment/app/streamlit_app.py as the
   entrypoint.
4. Provide required secrets/environment variables if the model is large or if
   the store model in a private location.

Streamlit Community Cloud is preferred for it is the fastest way to deploy
with minimal config.

## Notes & best practices

- The app reads artifact HTML files from the repo results/ folder. Regenerate
  them by running milestones/milestone3_xai/notebooks/03_explainability.ipynb
  when needed.
- We intentionally allow print() statements in notebooks for interactive
  debugging. Production code (this app) avoids noisy prints.
